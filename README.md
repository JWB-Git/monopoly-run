# monopoly-run
This PHP 'Web App' was originally developed for Newcastle Universities Student Scout and Guide Group (NUSSAGG) and City of Newcastle District Scouts to run a Monopoly Run event for Scouts. The app allows participants to go on a 'run' to multiple locations, take and upload photos and answer questions on that location. The event organisers can then view and approve these submissions and the system will give the participants a score.
